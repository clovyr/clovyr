# Clovyr

[Watch](https://github.com/clovyr/clovyr/subscription) this repo's releases for notifications about new libraries and major releases.

## Libraries

### Haskell

- [aeson-yaml](https://github.com/clovyr/aeson-yaml): Encode any Aeson (JSON) value as YAML (in pure Haskell). This library does not depend on any external YAML library with C bindings, like `yaml`, or a restrictive license, like `HsYaml` (GPLv3). It also works with GHCJS and Eta.

- [string-fromto](https://github.com/clovyr/string-fromto): A collection of predictably-named functions (e.g. byteStringToString) that convert between the common string types, as well as to and from Base16, Base32, and Base64.
